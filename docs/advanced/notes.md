# 👩‍💻 Setup notes

**You never have to do these steps they are just documented so you know how we got to 
the initial project structure.  Also include some useful notes about things.**

## How the project was initialized 


The project starts off with a bunch of files which you might find unfamiliar.  There is no magic there though.
The basic directory structure was automatically created by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev). 

First, you need to install Node.js on your computer if you haven't already.  You can download the latest version [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).  Verify that you have the `npm` command in your terminal program of choice.


Next, I initialized a default Vite project:

```sh
mkdir smile
cd smile
npm create vite@latest .
```

It asked me for a project name ("smile"), a framework ("vue"), and a variant ("vue" meaning vanilla javascript, not typescript).
Then you just run `npm i` to install all the dependencies.

Next, I installed the documentation system, [Vitepress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org).  From inside
the smile folder:

```sh
npm add vitepress --save-dev
mkdir docs && echo `# Smile` > docs/index.md
```

Then I added these commands to the `package.json` file:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "docs:dev": "vitepress dev docs",
    "docs:build": "vitepress build docs",
    "docs:serve": "vitepress serve docs"
  },
  ...
}
```

To run the documentation locally then I just type `npm run doc:dev` and open the provided localhost link.
The documentation on how to configure Vitepress is [here](https://vitepress.vuejs.org).





## Node package manager (npm)

The project assumes that you are using node package manager (npm).  Generally all commands involve `npm <something>`.

An important file here is `package.json` which describes the javascript dependencies of the current project but
also provides a set of commands available for managing the project.  The content contains something like this:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "docs:dev": "vitepress dev docs",  // this is a docs command!
    "docs:build": "vitepress build docs", // this too
    "docs:serve": "vitepress serve docs" // this too
  },
  ...
}
```

In the `scripts` section, you see several commands.  To run them you just type `npm run <cmd>`. 
For instance typing `npm run docs:dev` will effectively run the command `vitepress dev docs`.  
The `npm run <cmd>` commands are just aliases/shorthands for running build steps of the 
vitepress documentation system, and later for the 🫠 Smile project itself.  It is similar to a
Makefile.  Anytime you forget the possible commands just type `npm run`
on a line by itself and you'll get a listing like this:

```
➜ npm run
Scripts available in smile@0.0.0 via `npm run-script`:
  dev
    vite
  build
    vite build
  preview
    vite preview
  docs:dev
    vitepress dev docs
  docs:build
    vitepress build docs
  docs:serve
    vitepress serve docs
```

## GitHub Actions - Vitepress Docs

The script which runs the deploy action is located at `.github/workflows/docs-deploy.yml`.  This relies on several "secrets" which are configured in the GitHub website's repository settings (these are environment variables hidden from the public GitHub repo since they contain sensitive information).  A few other notes:
- This is the [rsync package](https://github.com/Burnett01/rsync-deployments) used.  
- I also found [this guide](https://zellwk.com/blog/github-actions-deploy/) helpful.
