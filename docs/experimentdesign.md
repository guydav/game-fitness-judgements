## Captcha

Very fast tasks, requiring human common sense, that are diverse, unpredictable, and have a large number of incorrect responses.


- view everyday photos and answer common sense reasoning question sby clicking on the image in a location (e.g., picture of two people one laughing and say "click on the happy one")

100 images
an interesting image -- click on the with masks that are appropriate

- show an image and record where you click on it

- move an object in a physics/phaser game to achieve something


- normal distorted text (type the word that you can see)

- move a slider slowly so that it doesn't wake up a bear (too fast == wake up, beat clock on time)

- watch a crazy video and type the words it says

## Informed Consent

The text of the informed consent should be updated for each study and placed in `src/components/atoms/InformedConsentText.vue`.  After participants accept the informed consent (usually the first few steps of study) they will see a button that will always be available allowing them to re-review the consent form in case they have questions.

## Withdraw

As part of most IRB approved protocols participants should be eligible to withdraw from a study at any time for any reason.  Online this is as simple as closing the browser windows and moving onto something else.  However, <SmileText/> provides a simple way to withdraw at any time from a study.

When participants click this button (only appears after accepting the informed consent), then they are presented with a form with several optional questions about why they are withdrawing and also providing information about partial compensation.  If a participant is eligible for partial compensation depends on several things specific to each study.  When they submit this form they will be taken to a final page asking them to return the task/hit.  It is the responsibility of the experimenter to monitor withdraws and to try to contact the participant.

## WindowSizerPage

The window sizer is a small component `src/components/pages/WindowSizerPage.vue` that will display a box with a configured size on the screen and asked the participant to adjust their browser window to that size so everything is visible.   It looks like this:

![Window Sizer](/images/windowsizer.png)

The size of the box is configured in `env/.env` file using the `VITE_WINDOWSIZER_REQUEST` configuration option.  The default value is `800x600` which means 800 pixel wide and 600 pixels tall.  You can change these values as needed.  In development mode you will need to restart the development server since environment files are only read once on the loading of the application.

To add it to the timeline just add this in the appropriate place inside `src/router.js`;

```js
// windowsizer
timeline.pushSeqRoute({
  path: '/windowsizer',
  name: 'windowsizer',
  component: WindowSizer,
})
```
