What are the types of web experiment things we are doing as a lab generally?  I guess we might want to see if there's a solution that covers some or most of what people wanted.  Let‚Äôs take a look at some recent papers and proposed projects‚Ä¶

## Future designs

What are the kinds of things we might want to do in the future?

| :star_struck: Undergrad research projects | **Need something easy to teach with** |
| Emily build a game to teach     |   complex, dynamic interactions, maybe phaser  |
| Question asking                 |   complex, dynamic interactions, generalization to new task  |
| Baba is not RL                  |   sprite based game would be helped by phaser, or just generally dynamic task  |
| Future helping exps             |   build on the phaser multiplayer thing        |
| Intuitive physics (video)       |   video manipulations and ratings of videos    |
| Intuitive physics (sims/interact) |  some type of in-browser game engine with physics |
| Human-machine interaction       |  open ended |
| Complex 3d interactions (ala Guy) | Unity and stuff | 
| Reinforcement learning and language | basic stuff, jspsych or the like |
| Future "psychology" exps (memory, decision making) | basic stuff, jspsych or the like |
