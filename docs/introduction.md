# :wave: Introduction

The goal of <SmileText/> is to make it easy and fun to collect behavioral data online.

The project is currently in the development and planning stage. We are taking a "docs first" approach to this project by planning the development within the documentation and then working on implementation. 

The current development is happening at [https://github.com/nyuccl/smile](https://github.com/nyuccl/smile).

There are two ways to get started with Smile: 
- If you are already using Smile in your lab, install the [required software](/requirements) to get started developing your own experiments.
- If you are setting up Smile for the first time use in your lab, jump to the [lab config](/labconfig) docs for configuring your services. 

The design choices in Smile were made so that it is relatively painless for developers to make new experiments after your lab performs the one-time setup.  This handy flow chart gives an overview of the process:
