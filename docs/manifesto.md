# ⚡️ The 🫠 Smile Manifesto
The lab experiment workflow, particularly psiTurk, has become a burden.  It is complex, it only works with Mechanical Turk, and is nearly 10 years old in terms of its thinking and architecture.  It’s time to move on.

- We need a new lab workflow for doing experiments based on up-to-date web technologies.
- Want making experiments to be fun, exciting, easy, not time consuming.
- It needs to accomodate multiple recruitment channels (AMT, prolific, etc…) with the same code base.
- Key is to make this a **progressive**[^1] framework in that simple and common stuff is done super simply and *extremely fast and error free* but complex stuff is still possible down the line by adding stuff when you need it.
- A relatively straightforward cognitive psychology type experiment should take a day or so.
- Sharability and modularity are critical.  If one lab member makes a great implementation of something everyone should be able to add it to their experiment in 5-10 minutes.

- Want to use technology to help reduce errors and bugs in our collected datasets.
- Want to simplify the process of getting from data -> data analysis.
- Noone in the lab should ever be tempted to use Qualtrics which is to say things should be about that easy.

[^1]: A progressive frameworks means that you only add what you need.
