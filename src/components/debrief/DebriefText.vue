    <p>Thank you for your participation in our study. 
      Your participation makes an essential contribution to our understanding of how people judge and evaluate games.</p>
    <p>
      Our research aims to better understand how people evaluate games.
      In the task, you read the descriptions of various games created to be played in a virtual room.
      You described the games in your own words, answered a few multiple-choice questions about the games, and provided an overall impression of each game.
      Your evaluations will help us understand how people judge games.
      Particularly, we will look for commonalities and differences between the evaluations provided by different people for different games.
