            Before we begin we'd like you to solve a couple quick problems for us,
            just to warm up your brain. They are common sense questions and tasks
            that should be easy and fun if you are a human.
        </p>
        <p class="is-size-5 has-text-left">
            Each question will need to be answered as quickly as possible.  If you don't respond
            in time it will move to the next question.  
        </p>
        <p class="is-size-5 has-text-left">
            Your speed and accuracy in answering these questions will help us verify that you are a human.
        </p>
        <p class="is-size-5 has-text-left">
            Only begin when you are ready to focus because if you fail to respond to too many questions, 
            your answers are incorrect, your response times appear irregular, you may be flagged as likely a bot
            and your compensation will be denied.
